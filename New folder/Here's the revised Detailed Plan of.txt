Here's the revised "Detailed Plan of Website Components, Functionality, and Navigation," with specific attention to the Right Preview Panel:
I. Overall Application Structure & State
Root Component (App.js or similar):
Manages the overall application state, including:
resumeData: The core object holding all resume content.
selectedTemplate: String, ID of the currently active resume template (e.g., "Stockholm").
accentColor: String, hex code for the current accent color.
fontSettings: Object, { primary: '...', secondary: '...', size: '...', spacing: '...' }.
paperFormat: String (e.g., 'A4', 'Letter'), influencing aspect ratio.
currentEditorView: String, determines which main view is active ('editor', 'templateSelector').
currentEditorSection: String, determines which section in the editor is active/scrolled to.
resumeScore: Number, calculated based on completeness.
Renders the main layout.
Main Layout Component (MainLayout.js):
Left Panel (EditorPanel.js):
Receives resumeData, currentEditorSection, and functions to update them.
Conditionally renders either the EditorForm or TemplateSelectorControls based on currentEditorView.
Right Panel (PreviewPanel.js):
Positioning: Occupies the right side of the viewport, typically flex-grow: 1 to take remaining space. Background color often slightly darker than the editor or textured to make the "paper" stand out.
Receives resumeData, selectedTemplate, accentColor, fontSettings, paperFormat.
Contains PreviewPanelHeader.js and ResumePreviewWrapper.js.
II. Left Panel Components (EditorPanel.js)
(This section remains largely the same as previously detailed, covering EditorHeader.js, EditorForm.js with its various input sections like PersonalDetailsSection.js, EmploymentHistorySection.js, etc., and EditorFooter.js. The collapse/expand for "Add more details", and delete/rearrange for repeatable sections are part of these component plans as outlined before.)
A. Editor Header Component (EditorHeader.js)
(As previously detailed: Logo, Resume Score Display)
B. Editor Form Component (EditorForm.js - Visible when currentEditorView === 'editor')
(As previously detailed: Contains SectionAccordion.js items for Personal Details, Employment, Education, Skills, Summary, and dynamically added sections)
B.1. Personal Details Section Component (PersonalDetailsSection.js)
"Add more details" / "Hide additional details" Toggle Link:
Functionality: Manages a local boolean state (e.g., isExtraInfoVisible). On click, toggles this state. The additional fields (Postal Code, Driving License, etc.) are conditionally rendered based on this state. Text of the link and arrow icon change.
B.2. Employment History Section / Education / Skills (Repeatable Sections)
Delete Icon (Trash Can):
Functionality: On click, triggers a confirmation modal. If confirmed, the parent component (e.g., EmploymentHistorySection.js) updates its state by removing the corresponding item from the resumeData.employmentHistory array.
Drag Handle Icon:
Functionality: Enables drag-and-drop reordering using a library (e.g., react-beautiful-dnd). On drop, the parent component updates the order of items in its respective array in resumeData.
B.3. Editor Footer Component (EditorFooter.js)
(As previously detailed: Back, Progress Dots, Next buttons)
C. Template Selector Controls (TemplateSelectorControls.js - Visible when currentEditorView === 'templateSelector')
(As previously detailed: Back to editor, Tabs for Templates, Text, Layout, and their respective controls)
Functionality: All controls here (template selection, color pickers, font/layout dropdowns) update the corresponding state variables in App.js (selectedTemplate, accentColor, fontSettings, paperFormat). These changes are immediately passed to the ResumePreview.js in the Right Panel, causing it to re-render.
III. Right Panel Components (PreviewPanel.js)
A. Preview Panel Header (PreviewPanelHeader.js)
Position: Top of the Right Panel.
Elements & Functionality:
"Change template" Button (Grid Icon - sc-ibDJdw jxtNwK in video):
Position: Top-left (sometimes shown here, sometimes in Editor Header).
Functionality: On click, updates currentEditorView in App.js to 'templateSelector', switching the Left Panel to template controls.
"Download PDF" Button (DownloadPdfButton.js):
Position: Top-right.
Functionality: Triggers PDF generation of the ResumePreview.js content.
B. Resume Preview Wrapper (ResumePreviewWrapper.js)
Positioning: This component is responsible for centering and scaling the actual resume "sheet" within the available space of the PreviewPanel.js.
Styling:
display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 100%; padding: 20px; overflow: auto; (The overflow: auto allows the wrapper to scroll if the scaled resume is still taller than the viewport, but the resume sheet itself doesn't get internal scrollbars).
Elements & Functionality:
Resume "Sheet" Component (ResumeSheet.js or the main ResumePreview.js itself if structured this way):
Props: Receives resumeData, selectedTemplate, accentColor, fontSettings, paperFormat.
Appearance:
Styled to look like a physical sheet of paper (e.g., white background, subtle box-shadow).
Dimensions & Aspect Ratio:
The paperFormat prop (e.g., 'A4', 'Letter') determines the base aspect ratio.
A4: ~1 / 1.414
Letter: 8.5 / 11 = ~1 / 1.294
It sets a max-width (e.g., 800px or a percentage of the PreviewPanelWrapper).
The height is set to auto to maintain aspect ratio, or calculated: width / aspectRatio.
Alternatively, use the aspect-ratio CSS property: aspect-ratio: 1 / 1.414; (for A4).
It scales down to fit the width of its container (ResumePreviewWrapper.js) while maintaining this aspect ratio. If the container is very tall, the resume might not fill the full height if its width is constrained.
Content Rendering:
This component is the core renderer. It will have a structure like:
<div class="resume-template-stockholm"> <!-- Class changes with template -->
   <style> /* Template-specific CSS, or linked stylesheet */
     /* ... styles for Stockholm template ... */
     /* Use CSS variables for accentColor */
     :root { --resume-accent-color: ${props.accentColor}; }
   </style>
   <header class="resume-header">
     <h1 class="name">${resumeData.personalDetails.firstName} ${resumeData.personalDetails.lastName}</h1>
     <div class="contact-info">...</div>
   </header>
   <section class="profile-summary">
     <h2>Profile</h2>
     <div>${resumeData.summary}</div>
   </section>
   <section class="employment-history">
     <h2>Employment History</h2>
     ${resumeData.employmentHistory.map(job => `...`)}
   </section>
   {/* ... other sections ... */}
</div>
Use code with caution.
Html
It will dynamically generate HTML elements based on the resumeData.
The class name of the root div (e.g., resume-template-stockholm) will change based on selectedTemplate prop. This allows for entirely different CSS rules and layouts per template.
Font families and sizes are applied based on fontSettings (either via CSS variables or direct style application if the template supports it).
"Expand/Full Screen" Icon on the preview itself (sc-kBIGSu cifDYK):
Position: Often overlaid on the resume preview (e.g., top-right corner of the sheet).
Functionality (as seen in video): Clicking this icon (at 0:22) transitions the Left Panel to the TemplateSelectorControls. So, it's another entry point to template customization, effectively maximizing the preview area while template controls are shown. It's not a simple zoom of the preview in its current context but a view state change.
C. Preview Panel Footer (PreviewPanelFooter.js)
Position: Bottom of Right Panel.
Elements & Functionality:
"Saved" Status Indicator (SaveStatus.js).
Page Navigation (PageNavigator.js): "< 1 / 1 >". (For multi-page resumes, this would allow changing the previewed page).
IV. How Additional Sections Work (Reiteration with Panel Context)
User navigates to the "Add Additional Sections" step in the Left Panel (EditorForm.js).
The EditorForm.js displays choices (Custom Section, Courses, Hobbies, Languages, etc.).
User clicks "Languages" in the Left Panel.
This action updates activeAdditionalSections in the root state (App.js).
The EditorForm.js re-renders, now including <LanguagesSection />. The currentEditorSection state in App.js is updated to 'languages', causing the form to scroll to/focus on the new Languages section in the Left Panel.
The ResumePreview.js in the Right Panel also re-renders, now including a "Languages" section based on the (initially empty) resumeData.languages array.
User fills in language details in the Left Panel. The Right Panel preview updates live.
User clicks "Done" (on the Languages section form) or "Finish" (on the Add Additional Sections summary screen) in the Left Panel to proceed.
V. What Happens When User Clicks "Change Template" (Reiteration with Panel Context)
User clicks "Change template" button (either in Left Panel's EditorHeader.js or Right Panel's PreviewPanelHeader.js).
currentEditorView state in App.js changes to 'templateSelector'.
The Left Panel (EditorPanel.js) now conditionally renders TemplateSelectorControls.js instead of EditorForm.js.
TemplateSelectorControls.js displays:
Template thumbnails (Toronto, Stockholm, etc.). Clicking one updates selectedTemplate state.
Accent color choices. Clicking updates accentColor state.
Text and Layout tab controls, updating fontSettings and paperFormat states.
The Right Panel (PreviewPanel.js) continues to display ResumePreviewWrapper.js and ResumeSheet.js.
As selectedTemplate, accentColor, fontSettings, or paperFormat states change in App.js (due to interactions in the Left Panel), these new prop values are passed to ResumeSheet.js.
ResumeSheet.js re-renders, applying the new template's CSS, colors, fonts, and potentially adjusting its layout and aspect ratio based on the new paperFormat. The content (resumeData) remains the same.
User clicks "Back to editor" in the Left Panel (TemplateSelectorControls.js).
currentEditorView state in App.js changes back to 'editor'.
The Left Panel reverts to showing EditorForm.js, with the last active section. The selected template, colors, etc., are now "applied."
